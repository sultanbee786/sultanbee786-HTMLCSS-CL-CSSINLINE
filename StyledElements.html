    <h1>CSS styling</h1>

    <p>This exercise relies on inline CSS - style rules applied to an individual element, within the element itself.
    In total, there are three ways to introduce CSS: inline (as shown here), embedded (written in the HTML head),
    and external (written in a separate file.) External CSS is generally preferred because separating style rules into
    its own file results in a more efficient separation of concerns.</p>

    <p style = "font-style: italic" >This text is italic</p>
    
    <p style = "font-size: 30px" >This text is big</p>
    
    <!-- TODO: Make this text italic -->
    <p id = "italic">Please make this text italic</p>

    <!-- TODO: Make this text small -->
    <p id = "small">Please make this text small</p>

    <!-- TODO: Center this text -->
    <p id = "center">Research spike: put this text in the center of the screen (you'll have to look up how to do it)</p>

    <!-- OPTIONAL PRACTICE: If you want more practice later, try changing the color of some text; then try changing the color AND centering simultaneously.
        Finally, try providing styling for an element other than a p tag.  -->
